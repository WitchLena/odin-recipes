    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The simplest thing for you to cook. If you have trouble doing this, you should try again 
        because everybody starts somewhere, and you shouldn't give up! Can be used in many other 
        recipes (such as our own <a href="./pbj.html">PB&J sandwich</a> recipe!) as a substitute 
        for untoasted bread. Also goes well with a topping such as butter, and a cup of tea.
    </p>

    <p>
        This recipe assumes the use of a classic top load toaster. Other appliances may be used, 
        however the steps may need to be modified to accommodate.
